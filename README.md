# Space Invaders
My attempt at recreating the classic space invaders game in pure JavaScript.
[\[PLAY HERE\]](https://tuhinshubhra.github.io/space-invaders-js/)
### How to play
- Use the cursor keys to navigate the spaceship
- Use `[SPACE BAR]` to shoot
- Destroy all enemy ships and the mothership to finish the game
- Or you can simpy die 5 times to end the game as well

#
PS: It's only a single level game.
PPS: There are some bugs which I'll prolly never fix.
